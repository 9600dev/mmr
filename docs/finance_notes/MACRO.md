* [The Greatest Predictor of Future Stock Market Returns](http://www.philosophicaleconomics.com/2013/12/the-single-greatest-predictor-of-future-stock-market-returns/): Total Return = Price Return from Change in Aggregate Investor Allocation to Stocks + Price Return from Increase in Cash-Bond Supply (Realized if Aggregate Investor Allocation to Stocks Were to Stay Constant) + Dividend Return.
* [Quit while you're ahead](https://www.hussmanfunds.com/comment/mc220325/): "The problem with simple P/E ratios (or even P/E ratios based on year-ahead estimates of “forward” earnings) is that stocks are not claims on a single year of earnings. A good valuation measure is just shorthand for a proper discounted cash flow analysis, and relates the current price with observable fundamentals that are representative of decades of likely future cash flows. High P/E multiples on earnings that rely on elevated profit margins. Once a high P/E and a high profit margin are embedded into price, both have to be sustained indefinitely in order for prices to avoid very strong headwinds."
* [My Investing Nightmare](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/my-investing-nightmare/): "While the Great Depression was objectively more damaging to capital markets, it happened over a much shorter time period. I cannot imagine seeing stocks decline consistently for four years only to be followed by a weak four year rally, then two more years of declines."
* [Modern Financial System and Constant Growth, a thread](https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1507391873379454981): "A high-leverage system can't take shocks. If businesses, households, and sovereigns are all highly-levered, it requires constant growth to avoid a systemic meltdown."
* [Great thread on poker and trading](https://twitter.com/NeckarValue/status/1506268234995187712): "Trading decisions should be based on conditional probability."; "Information doesn’t exactly flow perfectly, like they teach you in Finance 101. Frequently, the information will show up first in the option market. A lot of these insider trading cases involve options, and we’re the people who lose the money."
* [Minksy Moments in Venture Capital](https://pivotal.substack.com/p/minsky-moments-in-venture-capital?s=r): "Hyman Minsky was a 20th-century economist whose ‘financial instability hypothesis’ is probably the best-known explanation for the boom and bust cycles that characterize public financial markets. But there’s far less examination — in fact, there's almost none — of how Minsky dynamics apply to private markets."
* [Lecture on Minsky Moments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9_nqc-A5_Y). Steve Keen has several really interesting economics books, and says sensible things.
* [The Oil Market in six tweets](https://twitter.com/BurggrabenH/status/1504945787637227520): "The industry needs to replace ONE North Sea each year (3mbpd) just to stay still (more in future due to base declines). That needs $600bn. Industry didn’t and does not invest it. Meanwhile demand is back at pre-Covid levels."
* [Another good oil Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/PauloMacro/status/1505229277444325380)
* [Oil and the USD, good Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/UrbanKaoboy/status/1471531050396307462)
* [Asset bubbles and interest rates Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/INArteCarloDoss/status/1495475236980068360)
* [Gold and the USD Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/WifeyAlpha/status/1497879761330257922). Some links to papers that justify golds value.
* [Does not compute](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/does-not-compute/): "To suppose that the value of a common stock is determined purely by a corporation’s earnings discounted by the relevant interest rates and adjusted for the marginal tax rate is to forget that people have burned witches, gone to war on a whim, risen to the defense of Joseph Stalin and believed Orson Welles when he told them over the radio that the Martians had landed."
* [Geopolitics Megathread](https://twitter.com/UrbanKaoboy/status/1403757685225390087)

* [The Roaring 20's](https://roaring20s.substack.com/p/august-8-1921?s=r)
* [Thread on compounding](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1482367267291553799): "For example, take a savings account that starts with $1 and earns 10% per year -- compounded for 100 years. In the FIRST 10 years, the account grows by ~$1.59. In the LAST 10 years, it grows by ~$8,468. This is because wealth curves that grow exponentially are *non-linear* -- in fact, *convex* -- with respect to time."
